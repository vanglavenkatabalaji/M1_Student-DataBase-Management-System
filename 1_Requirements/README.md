# **STUDENT DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

## INTRODUCTION

STUDENT database management is a project that manages and stores students information electronically according to needs. The system helps both administrations and students manager to keep a constant track of all the students available in the school/college. It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired record.

The project titled STUDENT database Management System is student Management software for monitoring and controlling the transactions/migrations in a school/colege. The project "STUDENT database Management System" is developed in C, which mainly focuses on basic operations in a school like adding new student record, and updating new information, searching students and deleting student record.

This project “STUDENT database Management System” gives us the complete information about the students. We can enter the record of new students details and retrieve the details of students available in the school/college. In this project we can maintain the students who are in which class with their parents phone number and their prvious class percentage.

## OBJECTIVES
a) To build a system that can receive input and generate automatically output in easy way and short time.

b) To build a monitoring system that is able to monitor and manage all library operations efficiently.

c) Give an opportunity to administration office to reduce mistakes that always happen during manual method.

d) To store properly the student record items in order to maintain their security.

e) To enter and preserve details of the various issues and keep a track on their returns.

## **BENEFITS**
a) Record Maintenance.

b) Web-Based Solution.

c) Saves Time and Cost.

d) Secure and Reliable.

e) Increases Efficiency.

f) Simple and Easy to Use.

## **4W'S and 1H**

### Who
This Student Data Base Management System is an application is used by all the students, and staff who are having id's.

### What
Student Data Base Management  Systems is software that helps to maintain a database that is useful to enter new students & record students borrowed by the members, with the respective submission dates.

### When
This Student Data Base Management System is very useful when there are large no of students visit school/college to acess data, score, or take parents phone number. It is very tedious to enter the records manually so here this project come into handy.

### Where
The Student Data Base Management system is nowadays essential for schools, colleges. They can use this software as the purpose of books issuing and returning for renewal.

### How
This project is implemented to do the student record management purpose by entering the student or faculty details as input.

## **Swot Analysis**

### Strengths
a) Simple & Easy to Use.

b) Increased student record Engagement.

c) Efficient Cloud Data Management.

d) Highly Secure, Scalable & Reliable. 

e) Mobile Access.

### Weakness
a) The data stored is prone to cyber hacks.

b) Costly and Expensive.

c) Complicated to operate.

d) Online Systems require high-speed internet connectivity.

e) Risk of computer virus.

## Opportunities
The SDMS leaks outward into new spaces, spaces which it didn’t inhabit before, such as reading lists repositories, learning systems, research data management and so forth. Furthermore, it is likely that the future of library systems will consist of a mixture of open and closed systems as well as local and shared (or hosted) services.
